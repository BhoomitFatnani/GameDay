You are the Lead Backend Engineer for a climate monitoring system. Your network of weather sensors sends daily logs in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. However, the sensors are unreliable: some send corrupted data, missing values, or impossible readings (like negative humidity).

Your task is to build a Java Engine that reads this raw data stream, cleans it, and performs specific analytics.

The Data Format: Each line follows this format: Date,City,Temperature,Humidity,Status

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

City: String (e.g., "Mumbai")

Temperature: Integer (Celsius)

Humidity: Integer (%)

Status: String (e.g., "Normal", "Heatwave")

The Rules (Business Logic):

Data Cleaning:

Skip any row where Temperature or Humidity is "MISSING" or "N/A".

Skip any row where Humidity is negative (< 0).

Skip any row where Temperature is not a valid number (e.g., "Thirty").

The WeatherRecord Object: You must parse valid lines into a custom Java class/object.

Analytics:

Find the Hottest Day (Highest Temperature recorded across all valid data).

Calculate the Average Temperature for a specific city requested by the user.

Store the following in details.csv file:

17 2023-01-01,Mumbai,32,60,Normal 2023-01-01,Delhi,MISSING,40,Error 2023-01-02,Mumbai,35,55,Normal 2023-01-02,Chennai,41,80,Heatwave 2023-01-03,Kolkata,28,-10,Normal 2023-01-04,Mumbai,Thirty,50,Error 2023-01-05,Delhi,15,45,Cold 2023-01-05,Chennai,N/A,85,Error 2023-01-06,Bangalore,22,50,Normal 2023-01-06,Mumbai,,60,Error 2023-01-07,Delhi,12,40,Cold 2023-01-07,Kolkata,30,MISSING,Error 2023-01-08,Chennai,38,75,Normal 2023-01-08,Bangalore,20,-5,Error 2023-01-09,Mumbai,34,65,Normal 2023-01-09,Delhi,18,N/A,Error 2023-01-10,Kolkata,29,55,Normal

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, the number of log entries.

The next N lines contain the raw CSV log data.

The final line contains a String, representing the Target City to calculate the average temperature for.

Sample Input:

6 2023-01-01,Mumbai,32,60,Normal 2023-01-01,Delhi,MISSING,40,Error 2023-01-02,Mumbai,35,55,Normal 2023-01-02,Chennai,41,80,Heatwave 2023-01-03,Kolkata,28,-10,Normal 2023-01-04,Mumbai,Thirty,50,Error Mumbai

Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000

Temperature range: -50 to 60

Output Format

Line 1: Print Total Valid Records: [Count].

Line 2: Print Hottest Day: [Date] [City] ([Temperature]C).

Line 3: Print Average Temp for [Target City]: [Value].

Note: Print the average as a whole number (integer division is fine for this test) or formatted to 1 decimal place.

Sample Output:

Total Valid Records: 3 Hottest Day: 2023-01-02 Chennai (41C) Average Temp for Mumbai: 33
